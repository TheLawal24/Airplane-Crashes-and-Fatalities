Dataset
The dataset contains information on airplane crashes and fatalities since 1908,

including:

Date of crash
Location
Operator
Aircraft type
Number of fatalities
Cause of crash
Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

Libraries used are:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Geopy
Folium

For my Analysis:
i started with;

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Temporal Analysis:

I analyzed the crashes over time
Identified trends and patterns

Categorical Analysis:

Analyzes causes of crashes
Examined aircraft types and operators

Fatalities Analysis:

Investigated the number of fatalities per crash
Calculated survival rates
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive Statistics:

Summary statistics of key variables
Distribution of crashes and fatalities

Correlation Analysis:

Correlation between different variables
Identify significant relationships
Geographical Analysis
Geocoding Crash Locations:

i used Geopy to obtain latitude and longitude from location information
Handle cases where geocoding fails
Mapping Crash Locations:

i also used Folium to create an interactive map
Plot crash locations on the map
